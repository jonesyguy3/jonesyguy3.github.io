This is just a test to see how Jekyll is working. In truth I'll probably cheat after this class is over and use a CMS, but probably not Wordpress because those are lame, maybe joomla. I still appreciate this though to understand the full scope of things while I'm learning. Later on I'll take shortcuts.
